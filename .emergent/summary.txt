The previous AI engineer initiated the Raya mobile application development, focusing on connecting artists, partners, and venues. The project began by refining user requirements regarding authentication (settling on email/password), real-time chat, and admin functionalities. The AI engineer established a full-stack architecture using Expo (React Native) for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

Key progress includes setting up the core project structure, implementing user authentication, creating foundational screens (home, artists, partners, profile, wishlist, chat, about, contact), and integrating preliminary backend APIs for user management, artist/partner profiles, and payment (Razorpay, pre-activated). A significant portion of the work involved iterating on the app's dark blue and gold luxe theme, incorporating user-provided hex codes, fonts, and custom logo designs. The engineer also addressed critical features like artist availability, media uploads for profiles, profile pause/delete options, and an admin dashboard.

The iterative feedback loop with the user led to continuous refinements in UI/UX, feature additions (e.g., Get Featured section, My Chats screen, review functionality), and bug fixes, such as resolving a profile creation save error. The current state reflects a visually refined application with core functionalities in place, pending further polish and explicit completion of some features.

<product_requirements>
The Raya mobile app aims to connect artists, partners, and venues. Users can sign in as artists, partners, or venues via email/password. Artists and partners can upload/edit detailed profiles including stage name, experience, availability (days/times), location, price (per hour, negotiable), and multiple photos/videos. Venues can view artists/partners, wishlist favorites, filter by rating, experience, price, and availability, and engage in real-time chat. The app features a home page with the tagline Book. Collaborate. Get noticed. and One platform. Endless connections., redirecting to artists/partners. A Get Featured section allows artists/brands to pay for prime placement (₹199/week for artists, ₹999/month for brands), with Razorpay integration ready. Admin users require a separate dashboard to monitor chats, manage users (add/remove/edit profiles), and track app activity. The app's aesthetic is a modern, luxe dark blue (#000e27) and gold (#D4AF37, with accent shades #F9E28C, #E1C05B, #B98E1D) theme, with a custom 'R' logo, Cormorant Garamond for headings, and Poppins/Montserrat for body text. All images are to be saved in base-64 format.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo (React Native) frontend and a FastAPI (Python) backend using MongoDB.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: This is the core FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for user authentication (register, login, logout), user profile management (artist, partner, venue), featured listings, chat, admin analytics (user tracking, activity monitoring), and payment processing (Razorpay integration, pre-activated). The user model now includes fields like  and . It also handles filtering paused profiles for venues.
-   ****: Serves as the initial entry point/welcome screen. It has been updated to display the custom Raya logo prominently instead of text.
-   ****: Defines the bottom tab navigation. It includes conditional rendering to hide the Wishlist tab for non-venue users and styles the tab bar icons to be larger and positioned higher.
-   ****: The main home screen. It now features a redesigned Book. Collaborate. Get noticed. banner with a gold gradient, and displays the Raya logo instead of text, with updated styles for a luxe appearance.
-   ****: The user profile screen. It dynamically shows Create Profile or Edit Profile options. It contains buttons for Get Featured, Pause Profile, Delete Profile, and a link to the Admin Dashboard visible only to admin users. It integrates with  for user roles.
-   ****: Central screen for artists/partners to create and update their profiles. It supports text inputs for details like availability, location, and pricing. Crucially, it integrates  for uploading multiple photos and videos (stored as base64) and handles both POST (create) and PUT (update) API calls for profile submission.
-   ** and **: Dynamic route pages for displaying individual artist and partner profiles respectively, showcasing their details and availability.
-   ** and **: These screens provide the chat functionality;  lists conversations, and  is for specific conversations.
-   ****: A screen for submitting reviews, with a fix implemented to prevent app crashes on submission.
-   ****: The dedicated screen for admin users to view analytics and monitor app activity.
-   ****: Manages the authentication state of the user across the application, including login, logout, and user type (artist, partner, venue, admin).
-   ****: Centralizes the application's design system. It contains specific hex codes for the dark navy blue background (), various gold shades (, , , ), and white/off-white for text. It also specifies font families.
-   ****: Provides instructions for activating the Razorpay payment gateway once API keys are available.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of resolving a critical bug and implementing a design update. The immediate task involves fixing an error encountered when users attempt to save a *new* profile (as opposed to editing an existing one) via the  screen. The error stemmed from the assumption that  would always exist, which is not true for new profile creations. The AI engineer has identified this logic flaw and has successfully implemented a fix to correctly handle both profile creation (sending a POST request) and profile updates (sending a PUT request).

Concurrently, the user has provided a new logo image and requested that this gorgeous logo be updated and displayed prominently everywhere in the application, specifically mentioning the welcome screen and home page. The AI engineer has just started this process, with the explicit first step being to update the welcome screen logo.

The AI engineer successfully built the Raya mobile application from scratch, focusing on connecting artists, partners, and venues. The project progressed iteratively, addressing initial requirements for authentication, chat, and admin functionalities. The core full-stack architecture, utilizing Expo (React Native), FastAPI, and MongoDB, was established early on. Significant work involved refining the app's dark blue and gold luxe theme, implementing complex features like artist/partner profile management with media uploads, payment integration via Razorpay for Get Featured and subscriptions, OTP-based authentication flows, and a comprehensive admin dashboard.

Challenges included resolving conflicts with animation libraries (React Native Animated was adopted over Reanimated), fixing numerous backend API issues (405 Method Not Allowed, 422 Unprocessable Entity) by adding missing endpoints and refining Pydantic models, and rectifying frontend routing and display bugs. Despite extensive efforts, the video upload functionality for artist/partner profiles remained a persistent issue, with the user explicitly reporting it as unresolved. The engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging and implementing features, often using bulk updates for efficiency, and provided detailed summaries and status updates throughout the process.

<product_requirements>
The Raya mobile app aims to connect artists, partners, and venues. Users can sign in as artists, partners, or venues via email/password. Artists and partners upload detailed profiles (stage name, experience, availability, multiple cities, pricing, photos/videos, optional press kit). Venues can view artists/partners, wishlist favorites, filter by rating, experience, price, and availability, and engage in real-time chat. The app features a Book. Collaborate. Get noticed. home banner and a Get Featured section (paid placements via Razorpay: ₹199/week for artists, ₹999/month for brands). Admin users monitor chats, manage users (add/remove/edit), and track activity. The app's aesthetic is a modern, high-contrast minimalist, luxe dark blue (#000e27) and gold (#D4AF37, etc.) theme, with a custom 'R' logo, Cormorant Garamond headings, and Poppins/Montserrat body text. All images are to be saved in base-64 format. Later additions include OTP verification for signup/forgot password, a subscription model for venues (10 free views, then ₹499/month or ₹99/10 unlocks), and smooth video uploads.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Video Upload Fix:** The user explicitly reported that videos are still not getting uploaded, indicating an unresolved bug despite previous attempts.
-   **Partners Filter:** Frontend integration for filtering partners (by rating, experience, price, and availability) is still needed to match the functionality implemented for artists.
-   **Loading Speed Optimization:** A general requirement for artist/brand profiles to load faster was mentioned but not explicitly addressed or marked as complete.
-   **Chat Real-time (Socket.IO):** While HTTP polling is implemented, the original request for full real-time chat functionality that implies Socket.IO features like typing indicators and read receipts may still be pending.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user's explicit request to provide a comprehensive description of the Raya platform. This description was intended for artists asking about the platform and needed to communicate its value proposition, features, and launch status (launching this week).

The engineer delivered a detailed, marketing-oriented description (Chat Message 509) covering:
-   **General overview:** Raya's purpose and target audience (artists, brands, venues).
-   **Features for Artists:** Digital portfolio, discovery mechanisms (get featured, reviews), direct communication (chat), smart management (pause/update profile), and professional growth.
-   **Pricing:** Free features for artists, optional paid boosts (Get Featured).
-   **For Brand Partners:** Overview of services.
-   **For Venues:** Free trial, subscription options, and pay-as-you-go.
-   **Trust & Security:** OTP verification, secure profiles, transparent reviews, admin moderation.
-   **Launch & Coverage:** Launching this week in Bangalore, including specific areas.
-   **Call to action:** Download Raya.

This action fulfilled a direct informational request from the user, shifting temporarily from direct code development. Prior to this, the engineer was actively debugging and implementing the video upload functionality and the unpause profile feature. While the unpause functionality was successfully completed, the video upload issue was explicitly reported by the user as still not getting uploaded in Chat Message 501, making it the last unresolved development task.

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly debug and fix the persistent issue preventing video uploads for artist/partner profiles, ensuring smooth and functional video media handling.
